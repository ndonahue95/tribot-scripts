# Tribot Scripts

This is a collection of my tribot scripts. They are all developed in Java using the tribot API. These automate the processes of 2007 Runescape.

## saladFisher
Currently only fishes in Catherby for lobsters, banking them and implementing ABC2.

## orangeSals
A simple script to farm orange salamanders in the 3-tree location in the desert. Implements ABC2.

## blastSmither
Automatically smiths mithril bars at the blast furnace. Needs a lot of additions to be FULLY automated, but runs perfect in current state.
